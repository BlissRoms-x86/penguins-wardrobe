# CREATE WAYDROID DEBS

In ```../tools``` there is the script ```create_waydroid_debs.sh```

I use it to build waydroid in a VM and get DEBS in ~/WAYDROID_DEBS

Later I import the resulting DEBS in wardrobe and then 
install waydroid with:

```eggs wardrobe wear costumes/waydroid-bullseye``` 

or 

```eggs wardrobe wear wagtail```
