# colibri-jammy

This is a costume made from colibri, created for my development needs, particularly for eggs.

This version is adapted to Ubuntu 22.04 jammy and it's a bit different than the original.

I use to dress it on a xubuntu 22.04 minimum installation, to get all the original firmawares from Ubuntu.

The procedure to oblain an colibri-jammy, perhpas I will rename it as colibri-ubuntu becouse can be applied to Ubuntu 20.04 focal too, is:

* install xubuntu 22.04 and choose minimun installation
* install eggs
* eggs wardrobe get
* sudo eggs wardrobe wear colibri-jammy


It contains many firmwares and can be used on real computers.
