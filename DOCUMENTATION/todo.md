# working in progress...

It's long time I enjoy using Linux, both - professional and hobbist  - Started about 2000 with Red Hat and Debian, switched to Debian with Knoppis, using Proxmox Ve since version 0.7.

I was really fashinated from knoppix, some so nice to use and install who you can browse the we during the installations, at that time was common not.

With remastersys and - later with systemback - I arranged my customization too, not only for work, not only for hobbies.

Same year later, with the end of systemback and experience buildin a pxe server in our office, I started to think about some to replace them, from this idea come eggs.

eggs is capable of remaster, take a system and get a live iso. With the time, and collaborations, I thouth to something to master not only re-master. 

wardrobe is an answer of the needs everyone trying to create on Debian, Devuan, Ubuntu respin need to know, use and extend.
