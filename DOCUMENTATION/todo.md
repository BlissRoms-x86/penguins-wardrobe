# working in progress...

It's long time I enjoy using Linux, both - professional and hobbist  - Started about 2000 with Red Hat and Debian, switched to Debian with Knoppix, using Proxmox VE since version 0.7.

I was really fashinated from Knoppix, some so nice to use and install who you can browse the web during the installations, at that time was  not common at all.

With remastersys and - later with systemback - I arranged my customization too, not only for work, not only for hobbies.

Same year later, with the end of systemback and experience building and using a pxe server in our office, I started to think about some to replace them, from this idea come eggs.

eggs is capable of remaster, take a system and get a live iso. With the time, and collaborations, I thouth to something to do master not only re-master. 

wardrobe is an answer of the needs everyone trying to create on Debian, Devuan, Ubuntu respin need to know, use and extend.
